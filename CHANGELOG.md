## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Shared listener auth/bind validation service in `services/listener_security_service.py`.
- `tests/test_listener_and_diar_backends.py` covering listener security helpers and NeMo Sortformer compatibility paths.
- Prompt template scaffold in `assets/prompts/` with YAML index and built-in templates for meeting summary workflows.
- Prompt template loading/validation service in `services/prompt_template_service.py`.
- `tests/test_prompt_templates_and_config.py` covering prompt template loading and additive config behavior.
- Implementation task tracker for LLM post-processing in `docs/llm_postprocess_plan.md`.

### Changed

- `main.py` and `app.py` refactored to use shared listener security/auth helpers.
- Listener runtime initialization in `app.py` is now lazy to avoid unnecessary startup setup until listener code is needed.
- NeMo Sortformer handling now supports both modern callable diarizer APIs and legacy RTTM-output APIs.
- Sortformer availability checks now require both NeMo ASR importability and CUDA availability.
- Streaming transcript text updates are throttled in `services/transcription_service.py` to reduce UI churn while preserving final output.
- Qt transcript text area behavior in `ui_qt/main_window.py` updated for wrapping, sizing, and scroll behavior.
- `services/config_service.py` now includes additive LLM/template defaults for upcoming post-processing features.

### Fixed

- Listener and Qt config-save failures now log warnings instead of failing silently.
